            <h2 class="section-heading">GAMIFICATION AS COMPUTATIONAL MODELS</h2>
            <hr class="primary">
            <p class="text-left">This ‘game’ was initially conceived as a way for us to sieve out factors that affect why people choose to pay (or not pay) in an honour system. These factors will then be translated into data through a quantitative survey, which can be used to build an Agent-Based Model (ABM). ABMs simulate the actions of an individual, and allow the researcher to simulate the impact of actions of an autonomous agent on a larger system, through his/her interactions with other agents. <br><br>
            Thus, when the game was designed, it was viewed as a life-sized computational ‘model’ for reality. A computational ‘model’ does the job of reducing a complex, real-life problem into logical relations that can be evaluated with computers. In this case, the inputs could be the number of players, their relationship with each other, or their belief in the value of an honour system; the output would be the number of sticks they draw in each round. <br><br>
            A simple problem pops up -- the ‘inputs’ cannot be objectively quantified, but only subjectively quantified by the players/researchers. However, from a computational perspective, this experiment can still be treated as a ‘model’, with limitations imposed due to the subjectivity of the quantitative data. </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">GAMIFICATION IN SOCIAL RESEARCH</h2>
            <hr class="primary">
            <p class="text-left">From a sociological research perspective, the difficulty in studying USProvisions lies in the very presence of the researcher being in the same space as the consumer, which postulates an influence of surveillance and peer pressure and thus a change in the way the consumer behaves. The gamification of USProvisions allows the researcher to study a phenomenon that cannot be studied in its natural setting – it alleviates the issue of reflexivity, removing unnecessary external influence on the subjects in an attempt to study and understand them. Using gamification to study USProvisions thus allows the researcher to better understand the genuine intentions of participants in a honour system without creating an impression that they are being monitored, regulated, or judged.<br><br>
            Abstracting this further, gamification allows researchers to study a phenomenon considering both the overall influence of a structure and the autonomy of the individual. It allows for objective observation of the success or failure of an honour system as well as the subjective perspective of the participants given in the interviews, which together give a fuller picture of how agents navigate the imposed structure of an honour system. In this specific study, gamification provides a way to study social actions and intentions that people can be sensitive to and are less likely to be open about. Placing an honour system in the less intense setting of a game removes the researchers’ power in their relationship with the subjects, reducing the presence of the researcher and creates a more comfortable environment for participants to express themselves. <br><br>
            However, considering this study to be a model for consumer behaviour in USProvisions would not be meaningful in a sociological sense, since a natural setting cannot be completely mimicked, and generalizing the study to the rest of the community would be undermining the personal and unique intentions of each individual who has a part to play in the system. </p>
